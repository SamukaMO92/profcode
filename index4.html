            Sheets of empty canvas 
            <br> 
            Untouched sheets of clay 
            <br> 
            Were laid spread out before me 
            <br> 
            As her body once did
            <br> 
            <br> 
            All five horizons 
            <br> 
            Revolved around her soul 
            <br> 
            As the earth to the sun
            <br> 
            Now the air I tasted and breathed 
            <br>
            Has taken a turn
            <br> 
            <br>
            Oh, and all I taught her was everything 
            <br> 
            Oh, I know she gave me all that she wore 
            <br> 
            <br>
            And now my bitter hands 
            <br> 
            Chafe beneath the clouds 
            <br> 
            Of what was everything
            <br> 
            Oh, the pictures have
            <br> 
            All been washed in black
            <br> 
            Tattooed everything
            <br> 
            <br>
            I take a walk outside
            <br> 
            I'm surrounded by some kids at play
            <br> 
            I can feel their laughter
            <br> 
            So, why do I sear?
            <br> 
            <br> 
            Oh, and twisted thoughts that spin round my head
            <br> 
            I'm spinning, oh, I'm spinning
            <br> 
            How quick the sun can drop away?
            <br> 
            And now my bitter hands
            <br>
            Cradle broken glass
            <br>
            Of what was everything
            <br>
            All the pictures have
            <br>
            All been washed in black
            <br>
            Tattooed everything
            <br>
            All the love gone bad
            <br>
            Turned my world to black
            <br>
            Tattooed all I see
            <br>
            All that I am
            <br>
            All that I'll be, yeah
            <br>
            <br>
            I know someday you'll have a beautiful life
            <br>
            I know you'll be a star
            <br>
            In somebody else's sky, but why? Why? Why
            <br>
            <br>
            Can't it be, oh, can't it be mine?

            <br> 
            I've used hammers made out of wood 
            <br> 
            I have played games with pieces and rules 
            <br> 
            I undeciphered tricks at the bar, but now you're gone 
            <br> 
            I haven't figured out why 
            <br> 
            I've come up with riddles and jokes about war
            <br> 
            I figured out numbers and what they're for
            <br> 
            I've understood feelings and I've understood words
            <br> 
            But how could you be taken away?
            <br>
            <br> 
            And wherever you've gone and wherever we might go 
            <br> 
            It don't seem fair. Today just disappeare 
            <br> 
            Your light's reflected now. Reflected from apart 
            <br> 
            We were but stones. Your light made us stars
            <br>
            <br> 
            With heavy breath, awakened regrets 
            <br> 
            Back pages and days alone that could have been 
            <br> 
            spent together but we were miles apart 
            <br> 
            Every inch between us becomes light years now 
            <br> 
            No time to be void or save up on life 
            <br> 
            Oh, you got to spend it all
            <br>
            <br> 
            And wherever you've gone and wherever we might go 
            <br> 
            It don't seem fair. You seem to like it here 
            <br> 
            Your light's reflected now. Reflected from apart 
            <br> 
            We were but stones. Your light made us stars
            <br>
            <br> 
            And wherever you've gone and wherever we might go 
            <br> 
            It don't seem fair. Today just disappeared

            Your light's reflected now. Reflected from apart

            Unsealed on a porch, a letter sat 
            <br> 
            Then you said: I wanna leave it again 
            <br>
